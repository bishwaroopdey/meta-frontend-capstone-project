# Meta Front-End Developer Capstone Project

Welcome to the Capstone Project of the front end developer program. The Capstone project at the center of this course is based on a scenario involving the restaurant Little Lemon. In particular, the owners of Little Lemon have received negative feedback on the reserve a table function on the Little Lemon website. Users are confused about how to use it and unhappy with how it looks and functions.
